## Sorting and filtering

"Top" Button tooltip: "the most active topics in the last year, month, week or day"

- [ ] compare mobile

Sorting by "top" posts offers timespan filtering. Why only on "top"?

I guess this is an activity *index*, meaning activity per time. Still, the *numbers of replies* column counts total answers to topic, not answers within filtered timespans.

Which of this is needed for 1.0? What can be left out?

- "top": 1.0 nice-to-have
- Subforums / categories are structural: 1.0 must-have
- Tags are important for *some* users and more flexible than categories: 1.0 should-have
- Filter last 24h/week/month/year: 1.0 should-have or nive-to-have?

What is the relevance of "numbers of answers"?
- "hot" topics, lots conversation, more an emotional/social thing than acutal information value
- how could that be visualised other than the number?
- are few large posts really less hot than many short ones?
- whatever the answers and future alternatives: number of answers is 1.0 must-have

- icons without labels are tough. unecessary on large screens

- hover is used as hover color, not sure about it
- what kind of state is this?
