# Inititial Concept

- ✔ There should be a dummy Discourse instance for the people working on the Urbit version: https://urbit-dummy.trydiscourse.com/


---

- Each of the four blocks should have a first rough outline with screenshots.

  - ✔ Setup: what needs to be configured before people can start communicating?
  - Onboarding: Inviting, joining, guiding
  - Posting, editing, state manipulation
  - Moderation (this especially needs the mentioned open eyes to accomodate for Urbit's p2p architecture)

- There should be a clear prioritisation on what delivers the most value.
  - Since there is no innovation to do inititally, the emphasis should be on quality of functionality, not quantity (Half, Not Half-Assed).
